[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/holgerteichgraeber/ClustForOpt.jl.svg?token=HRFemjSxM1NBCsbHGNDG&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/holgerteichgraeber/ClustForOpt.jl)

[ClustForOpt](https://github.com/holgerteichgraeber/ClustForOpt.jl) is a [julia](https://www.juliaopt.com) implementation of clustering methods for finding representative periods for optimization problems. A utilization in a scalable capacity expansion problem can be found in the package [CEP](https://github.com/YoungFaithful/CEP.jl).

The package has two main purposes: 1) Provide a simple process of clustering time-series input data, with clustered data output in a generalized type system 2) provide an interface between clustered data and optimization problem.

The package follows the clustering framework presented in [Teichgraeber and Brandt, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.012).
The package is actively developed, and new features are continuously added. For a reproducible version of the methods and data of the original paper by [Teichgraeber and Brandt, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.012), please refer to branch `v0.1-appl_energy-framework-comp`.

This package is developed by Holger Teichgraeber [@holgerteichgraeber](https://github.com/holgerteichgraeber) and Elias Kuepper [@YoungFaithful](https://github.com/youngfaithful).
